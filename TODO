[ ] Add mermaid output
[ ] Handle the inherited type from the parent
[ ] Distinguish between private (-) and public (+) variables
[ ] Do not handle the direct allocation of variables from __init__. For example, here the type of employee_id and salary is Name.

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, employee_id: int, salary: float):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.employee_id = employee_id
        self.salary = salary

[ ] Max size calculator for methods doesn't work. Check if the string is well formatted before measuring.
